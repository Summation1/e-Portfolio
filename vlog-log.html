            3: "The Pursuit of Happyness is an inspiring movie based on the real story of Chris Gardner. It shows his journey from being homeless to becoming a stockbroker. Will Smith does a great job playing Chris, making the emotional scenes very real. The movie teaches us to work hard, stay strong, and never give up, no matter how difficult life gets. The bond between Chris and his son makes the story even more touching. As a BTech student, this movie is a great reminder to keep pushing forward, even when things seem impossible. A must-watch for motivation!",
