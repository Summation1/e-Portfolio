            1: "Hello! I am Shivanshu Agarwal, a BTech 3rd-year student with a passion for machine learning, computer vision, and web development. I have worked on several projects, including a Face Recognition Attendance System and a Speech Emotion Recognition System. I enjoy solving real-world problems through technology and continuously improving my skills in Python, C++, and full-stack web development ,Apart from academics, I am always eager to explore new technologies and enhance my knowledge in operating systems, compiler design, and artificial intelligence. My goal is to build efficient, user-friendly applications and contribute to innovative projects.",
            2: "I am Shivanshu Agarwal, a BTech 3rd-year student at Graphic Era Hill University, from Satpuli. I am passionate about machine learning, computer vision, and web development. My hobbies are playing cricket.",
            3: "The Pursuit of Happyness is an inspiring movie based on the real story of Chris Gardner. It shows his journey from being homeless to becoming a stockbroker. Will Smith does a great job playing Chris, making the emotional scenes very real. The movie teaches us to work hard, stay strong, and never give up, no matter how difficult life gets. The bond between Chris and his son makes the story even more touching. As a BTech student, this movie is a great reminder to keep pushing forward, even when things seem impossible. A must-watch for motivation!",
            4: "Today, we did a 1 vs 64 activity on Women Safety in India, where 64 students had to give individual suggestions, and the teacher argued against each one. It really pushed us to think deeply and come up with strong, practical points. In the end, only the most valid and logical ideas were selected, like improving public transport safety, faster legal action, and self-defense training for women. This activity helped us build confidence, critical thinking, and effective communication.",
            5: "Today, we did a group activity where a coal mine flooded, and four people were trapped: a child, a lady with asthma from the Survey of India, a mine owner, and a Nobel Prize-winning scientist who was also mad and in the last stage of leukemia. We had to choose three to save.Our group chose the child, the survey lady, and the mine owner. We didn’t choose the scientist due to his health and unpredictable behavior. This activity taught us how to think critically, prioritize logically, and collaborate under pressure.",
            6: "Today, we did a group activity where we had to choose one person from any field for the Bharat Ratna award. It helped us research inspiring personalities and understand how their work impacts the nation. We learned to work as a team—sharing ideas, listening to others, and making a fair decision together. This activity also improved our English speaking skills and gave us a deeper understanding of Indian culture and the value of the Bharat Ratna award.",
            7: "Today, we learned how to take part in a group discussion. I understood the importance of speaking clearly, listening to others, and staying calm while sharing my views. We should respect everyone’s opinion and use examples to support our points. This activity really helped me improve my confidence and communication.",
            8: "Today, we learned how to face personal interviews and handle tough questions. We were taught to stay calm, think before answering, and be honest if we don’t know something. Confidence, good body language, and clear communication are key. This activity helped me understand how to present myself better and answer tricky questions smartly.",
            9: "This semester with Vishal Chhabra sir has been an amazing journey. Through his sessions, I not only learned how to speak confidently in public, but also how to think critically in group discussions and interviews. Every activity — whether it was the coal mine rescue case study, 1 vs 64 debate, Bharat Ratna selection, or GD rounds — pushed me out of my comfort zone and made learning fun and practical.Sir’s way of questioning and challenging our answers helped us think deeper, stay logical, and express ourselves better. I also improved my body language, teamwork, and decision-making skills."
